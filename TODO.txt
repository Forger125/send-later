Share common code between toolbar and popup.

Stupid interval should be in seconds, not milliseconds.

Should Send Later mark a message "replied" or "forwarded" when sending
a delayed reply/forward?

Send Later column doesn't work in unified Drafts folder.

Support recurring scheduled messages.

Make it harder to accidentally press Send instead of Send Later once a
message has been scheduled (i.e., once the settings in the toolbar
have been modified or a previously scheduled draft is re-edited).

Add a preference for hiding the status message in the footer
completely.
